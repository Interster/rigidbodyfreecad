The rigid body dynamics workbench for FreeCAD.

This workbench assists in modelling rigid body dynamics from within the FreeCAD environment.  It uses built-in FreeCAD routines in order to calculate mass, inertia and centre of gravity of components.  Forces and moments are added to the simulation from within the FreeCAD environment.  Python routines are used to integrate equations of motion.
